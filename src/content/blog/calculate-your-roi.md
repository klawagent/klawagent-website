Most businesses hire virtual assistants thinking they're getting a deal. $15-25/hour sounds reasonable, right?

But when you add up the real costs — hours, sick days, training time, management overhead — the numbers tell a different story.

## The Hidden Costs of Virtual Assistants

A typical VA working 20 hours per week at $15/hour costs you $1,300 per month. But that's just the start:

- **Training time:** 2-4 weeks to get them up to speed
- **Management overhead:** Your time explaining tasks, checking work
- **Inconsistent availability:** Sick days, vacations, time zones
- **Limited hours:** Most VAs work 8-hour days, then you're on your own

## KlawAgent Works Differently

Instead of paying for human hours, you're paying for outcomes. KlawAgent works 24/7, never needs training, and scales instantly when you need more done.
