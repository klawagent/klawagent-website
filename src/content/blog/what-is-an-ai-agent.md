You've heard the buzz about AI. Maybe you've used ChatGPT to draft an email or summarize a document. That's useful — but it's not an AI agent.

An AI agent is different. It doesn't just respond to questions. It takes actions.

## The Difference Between a Chatbot and an Agent

A chatbot waits for you. You type something, it replies. You type again, it replies again. It's reactive, and it only does what you directly ask it to do.

An agent operates on your behalf. You give it a goal — "monitor my inbox and flag anything from a client" — and it works on that goal continuously, using tools, making decisions, and reporting back when it needs your input.

Think of the difference between hiring a consultant who answers questions, versus hiring an employee who owns a function of your business.

## What Can an AI Agent Actually Do?

A well-configured agent can:

- **Read and respond to emails** — triaging by priority, drafting replies in your voice, escalating urgent items
- **Manage tasks** — creating ClickUp tasks from conversations, updating statuses, assigning follow-ups
- **Monitor and summarize** — watching your Slack channels, your inbox, your calendar, and surfacing what matters
- **Communicate proactively** — sending updates to clients, following up on outstanding items, scheduling meetings

The key word is *proactively*. An agent acts without being asked. That's what makes it genuinely useful versus just another tool you have to manage.

## Why Now?

The models powering AI agents — like Anthropic's Claude — have crossed a capability threshold in the last 12 months. They can now follow complex multi-step instructions reliably, reason about context, and use tools (email, calendar, project management) without constant human correction.

Six months ago, an agent would make too many mistakes to trust with real business operations. Today, with the right setup and oversight, it can handle genuine workload.

## The Catch: Setup and Maintenance Matter

An AI agent is only as good as its configuration. A poorly set up agent hallucinates, takes wrong actions, or gets stuck. A well-configured one — with the right context, the right tools, and the right guardrails — becomes genuinely reliable.

That's the gap KlawAgent fills. We handle the deployment, the integrations, the configuration, and the ongoing maintenance so you get the leverage without the engineering work.

## What's Next

In future posts we'll cover how to think about what to delegate to your agent first, how to evaluate whether it's working, and what separates a useful agent from one that creates more work than it saves.
