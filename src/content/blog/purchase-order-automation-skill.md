The AI world is obsessed with demos. Flashy presentations where chatbots answer trivia questions or generate creative writing. Meanwhile, your business runs on purchase orders, vendor emails, and the thousand small tasks that happen between "order placed" and "product shipped."

That's why we built something different: a Purchase Order Acknowledgment skill that doesn't just chat about your business — it runs your business.

## Real Automation for Real Businesses

Here's what actually happens when a purchase order hits your inbox:

Someone opens the email. Checks if the PO number exists in your system. Searches for the document in your files. Verifies inventory availability. Drafts a response. Sends it back to the vendor. Updates your team in Slack.

That's 15 minutes of focused work for what should be a 30-second automated process.

Our PO acknowledgment skill handles the entire workflow:
- **Email monitoring** — watches your configured email addresses 24/7
- **Smart parsing** — extracts PO data from any format (PDF attachments, tables, plain text)
- **System integration** — verifies against QuickBooks, Square, Shopify, or your custom ERP
- **Document matching** — finds existing PO files in Drive, Dropbox, or local storage
- **Professional responses** — generates acceptance, rejection, or clarification emails
- **Team notifications** — updates your Slack channels with status changes

## Why Business Skills Matter More Than Chat

Every business owner has the same problem: too many small tasks that require human judgment but don't require human intelligence. Purchase order acknowledgment is the perfect example.

It requires:
- Understanding different email formats
- Cross-referencing multiple systems
- Following your business rules
- Communicating professionally with vendors
- Keeping your team informed

But it doesn't require creativity, intuition, or complex decision-making. It's pure process — exactly what AI should handle.

## Day-One Integrations That Actually Work

The skill connects to the systems you already use. No complicated migrations or new software to learn:

**Email Platforms:**
- Gmail (OAuth or App Passwords)
- Outlook/Office 365 (Microsoft Graph API)
- Generic IMAP/POP3 servers
- Exchange Server

**ERP & Accounting Systems:**
- QuickBooks Online & Desktop
- Xero
- SAP Business One
- NetSuite
- Sage 50 & 100
- FreshBooks
- Custom databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server)

**Point-of-Sale & E-commerce:**
- Square
- Shopify
- WooCommerce
- BigCommerce
- Stripe
- PayPal Commerce

**Document Storage:**
- Google Drive (any folder structure)
- Dropbox Business
- Microsoft SharePoint
- Local network drives (SMB/CIFS)
- Amazon S3
- Box

**Team Communication:**
- Slack (channels, DMs, mentions)
- Microsoft Teams
- Discord
- Email notifications
- SMS alerts (Twilio)

The configuration wizard walks through your specific setup in 15 minutes. No technical knowledge required — just answer questions about how your business works today.

## The Real Test: Does It Work While You Sleep?

The difference between a demo and a business tool is what happens at 2 AM.

Your vendor in Germany sends a purchase order. Your agent reads it, verifies it against your inventory system, confirms the delivery date works with your schedule, and sends back a professional acknowledgment — all before you wake up.

Your team arrives Monday morning to find three new orders processed, documents filed correctly, and Slack updated with the details. No human touched it. No errors. No delays.

That's the difference between AI that impresses in meetings and AI that runs your business.

## Why We Focus on the Boring Stuff

Silicon Valley builds AI that writes poetry. We build AI that processes purchase orders.

Poetry doesn't pay payroll. Purchase order efficiency does.

Every small business owner knows the feeling: buried in administrative tasks that feel important but don't grow the business. Email after email. Document after document. The same process repeated dozens of times each week.

Those "boring" processes are where AI creates real value. Not because they're technically impressive, but because they free up human time for work that actually requires humans.

## What's Next for Business Automation

The PO acknowledgment skill is part of a larger shift at KlawAgent: building AI that works for everyday businesses, not just enterprise companies with dedicated IT teams.

We're developing a full suite of business automation skills:
- Invoice processing and payment tracking
